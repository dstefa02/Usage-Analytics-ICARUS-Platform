# Usage-Analytics-ICARUS-Platform
The main scope of the Usage Analytics component is to provide meaningful platform utilization insights and aggregated statistics based on the usage of the various services and assets of the ICARUS platform. Usage Analytics provides the following processes for data analytics: 
* collect data
* store data
* aggregate data
* visualize data

The visualized aggregated statistics focus on specific types of ICARUS users (i.e. asset provider, asset consumer, admin) and they do not reveal any information related to another user. In terms of design, the Usage Analytics is composed of the following subcomponents: Usage Analytics Handler, Usage Analytics Storage, Usage Analytics Queue and Usage Analytics API.
